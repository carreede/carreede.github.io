<p style="text-indent: 40px">
        My name is Devin Carree, and I am an aspiring neurosurgeon, biomedical researcher and philosopher from the east side of Detroit, MI. I have selected a career in the medical field at a very young age because my mother told me to. At the age of 4 years old (the age I have been telling people for as long as I can remember) my mother asked me, “What do you want to be when you grow up: an astronaut, the President of the United States or a doctor?” I chose doctor because I did not want to go to outer space and my older brother already had hopes of becoming the president. Each year since then I developed my goal, first to surgeon, then brain surgeon and sometime before the 3rd grade, although I did not know exactly how the terms were related, I knew that I wanted to be a neurosurgeon. My goal at a very early age, after witnessing a close cousin who suffered from cerebral palsy fail to read a sentence correctly, was to “cure mental retardation”. I am extremely goal-orientated and optimistic. Many people over my lifetime has told me that “because my mom told me to” is not a good enough reason to sustain the enthusiasm and interest that it takes to overcome the hardships of becoming a doctor. As I grew older (middle school/ high school) and began thinking more abstractly, these thoughts became the foundation of my philosophical thinking. I knew that I wanted to become a doctor, but beside my mother telling me to, I did not know why. Coming from and underserved community underrepresented in the medical field, there were no images of successful Black doctors, or family members in college or going into their careers that motivated me to become a doctor but, somehow, I knew that I wanted work in a science lab for the rest of my life.
</p>
<br>
  <p style="text-indent: 40px">
        My goal in life is to learn as much as possible about the world and existence in general. A phrase that I read early in life solidified my goals of becoming a neurosurgeon, “Shoot for the stars, for if you miss at least you’ll be among the moon.” This phrase is my motto and I apply it frequently when selecting goals. By learning as much as I possibly can I hope to gain enough information to eliminate cognitive and genetic disorders such as, Angelman’s syndrome and Down syndrome. I plan to increase treatments and therapies for and significantly reduce neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, Amylolytic Lateral Sclerosis and Dementia. I also intend to work to understand the intricacies of autism, ADHD, OCD, anxiety and depression by defining currently undefined brain regions and increasing neurodiagnostic imaging methods such as some sort of brain activity related to genetic activation/suppression.
</p>
<br>
  <p style="text-indent: 40px">
        My goal is reflected in my coursework. I entered Michigan State University as a junior with a major in human biology and a graduate of Lansing Community College with an associates of science degree in pre-professional health. After my first year at MSU, I felt that I had learned more information than ever in my life; I was not overwhelmed, and I was extremely excited to learn more about a human biology but that did not seem to reflect in my grade. Because of my enthusiasm to learn neuroscience, I was able to immerse myself in its notes and retain the knowledge better than I ever had before. This taught me how to take good notes. I also realized that my focus in human biology was too broad, so I narrowed it semester by semester based on my interests and goals, first adding the cognitive science minor, then the neuroscience major, then a biotechnology minor, then philosophy minor and finally a molecular genetics and genomics major. I believe this is the best background that I can attain in order to complete my goal of eliminating cognitive disabilities.
  </p>
<br>
  <p style="text-indent: 40px">
        After I become a physician, I will give back to the community that I grew up in and if possible other underserved communities as well. As an African American man from an underrepresented community and an underrepresented group in society, me becoming a physician would be the representation needed in society, for some of my peers and those looking up to me. Another one of my objectives that I hope to complete while aiming to learn everything physically possible is to become one of, if not, the most inspirational and motivating persons in the entire world and not just my community. Once I have the ability to, I plan to invest in neighborhoods, including the school systems, infrastructure, and housing to give opportunities to have the enthusiasm needed to thrive and succeed in life. I hope that me overcoming the obstacles that I have faced in my life as well as the sacrifices that I have made and plan to make in the future, inspires people to become the best person they want to be.
</p>
<br>
  <p style="text-indent: 40px">
        I am a spiritual person; I believe in all possibilities. I would be very excited if I were able to understand every aspect of existence, natural and unnatural (spiritual, supernatural, astrological, etc.) and connect them for the world to be able to understand. My motivation to learn medicine is very philosophical, it includes aspects of fate, merit and making my mother proud, I imagine situations such as reincarnation, karma, or her living vicariously through me where her life’s reward is me being the best person I can be and it motivates me.
